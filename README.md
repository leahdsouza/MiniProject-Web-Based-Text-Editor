# MiniProject-Web-Based-Text-Editor
The aim of this project is to create a web-based text editor. It is an open source software. The application is supported in Netscape based browers and Internet explorer. The user can edit text, write codes in various programming languages and add several html elements. The text-editor is formed using HTML and JavaScript to make the code as simple as possible.

Made in collaboration with Rebecca Aurelia Dsouza, Shaun Figueiro and Collin Ferreira.
